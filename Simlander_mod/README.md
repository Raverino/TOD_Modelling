# Modified SIMLANDER Code

This folder contains a modified version of the `allocator.R` script from the SIMLANDER v2.1.1 model.

To facilitate the changes inside the code search for the varibale **model_accessibility** (it allows you to change the weight of road and transit network) and the word **zoning** (it will briefly explain how it works). 
## üìå Changes Made:
- Integrated **transit accessibility** as an additional factor in the urban allocation process.
- Adjusted weight calculation to prioritize pixels closer to public transport.
- Aligned land-use inputs and output formats to match the TOD scenario framework used in the thesis.

## üîÅ Based on:
Original SIMLANDER code by Richard Hewitt  
Version: [v2.1.1](https://simlander.wordpress.com/2025/02/20/simlander-v2-1-1-released/)
